## Nice To have/ Future Features

### Implemented

#### Pagination

When the home page has above 8 posts, a new page is created, and a navigation button is created to navigate to the new page. The new page, then, has navigation to return to the previous page.
  
  - Next

### Future Implementations
  
  ### Mailing List
  A mailing list is a great way to let loyal customers know about upcoming events, discounts and products

  ### Discounts
  Add discounts to featured products so that they are not only graphically different from the others
  
  #### Comments
  Another common fearture that will be added in the future is comments. Comments create more interactivity and generates engagement. 

  #### Inventory
  The ability to track inventory and dynamically update the stock as items are purchased is an essential next step
  
  #### Reviews
  Customer reviews can drive engagement and site traffic as well as give the owner a good idea of what will sell

  #### Events
  Table-Top and boardgame communities are constantly looking for new players fro their own games and many boardgame stores run events for the community.
