## Business model

The business model is B2C, meaning the business sells to the customer. The focus is on one-off payements for products.

### A summary of the customer

Dungeon Dwellers is a site aimed at customers in a specific niche of boardgames and minatures. With a limited pool of a customer base, loyalty is a neccesity. As such, the sales process should be painless, providing top quality UX and UI.


### Strategy

Due to being a niche store, the customer base would expect the store to compete on the following:

- quality of products (licesned products)
- availability
- user experience
- service
- loayalty offers
- price

- ### Colour 

For the colours, I chose a muted palette to reflect an aged look, to promote the idea of an old shop that an adventurer might stumble across on their travels. I created variables within the base.css to generate various opacities of the base colours shown below and used them throughout the project, even substituting them for bootstrap's own colour classes.

- ### Typography

To continue the theme of an old shop holding treasures unknown, I used a [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) font, "MedievalSharp" which is stylized like an old font, but is still readable
