## Major Stumbling Blocks

Twice during this project, I ran into issues with the database where the only solution was to flush the data and start again. The current repo is actually the second attempt at this project, which is why there are more issues on the project boards than represented in the github repo. 

## Business model

The business model is B2C, meaning the business sells to the customer. The focus is on one-off payements for products.

### A summary of the customer

Dungeon Dwellers is a site aimed at customers in a specific niche of boardgames and minatures. With a limited pool of a customer base, loyalty is a neccesity. As such, the sales process should be painless, providing top quality UX and UI.


### Strategy

Due to being a niche store, the customer base would expect the store to compete on the following:

- quality of products (licesned products)
- availability
- user experience
- service
- loayalty offers
- price
